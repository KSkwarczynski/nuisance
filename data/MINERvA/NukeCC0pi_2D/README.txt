About this sample:

5 nuclear targets were analyzed: CH (aka scintillator, aka tracker region), 
C, H2O, Fe, and Pb as a function of muon P_{T} vs P_{||}.

Corresponding fluxes: data/flux/MINERvA_ME_Flux_Nuclear_Targets_Constrained.root

*important note:* Each target has its own flux which can differ up to +/-10% in the falling edge 
of the flux peak when compared to the CH flux. In addition, the CH measurement has 4 additional xsec
extractions that are reweighted to the flux of the respective nuclear targets. These should be used
when using the ratios. For a detailed description of the reweighting process, 
see the March 24, 2023 Fermilab W&C slide 37-43 here: https://indico.fnal.gov/event/58600/
Taking the ratio with different fluxes is wrong and does not capture the errors correctly.
